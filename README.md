### Topic: Modeling of Reading Accuracy Data for Elementary School Children

##### Summary
• Develop a model to measure reading accuracy for elementary school students using students’ reading ability data

• Assist in developing statistical models focusing on discrete distribution that capture heterogeneity in reading accuracy data

• Derive parameter estimates along with standard error estimates for the developed models

• Code model fitting and model evaluation in R

#### Description
This research focuses on assessing reading ability of elementary school children by applying statistical methods on collected data. Each child is given different passages to read and teachers mark how many words their student read wrong. We also collect another source of data through using an AI that analyzes students’ voices and automatically counts how many words they got incorrectly. Our purpose is to measure the measurement errors between two methods and apply different statistical distributions to see which distribution has the best potential to measure students’ reading ability accurately.

In this research, we use five different distributions: Poisson, binomial, beta binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated binomial.

#### Note
This is an ongoing research project. The estimated time of completion is 3 semesters, which means I still have two more semesters left. The reports uploaded will denote which semester it is and please note they are only reports, not the final research paper.
